# clawboo

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 0a9620a: Upgrade an existing `clawboo.db` in place instead of silently skipping the change. The schema is bootstrapped by one `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` block, and SQLite skips the whole statement when the table already exists, so a column added to an existing table never reached any database created before it: the upgrade looked clean and then failed at runtime on the first query that touched the column, with delete-and-recreate the only working repair. `ensureSchema` now reconciles first, reading the declared column set back out of that same DDL and adding whatever an existing table is missing, then applies the DDL batch. That order matters: a new column usually ships with an index over it, and `CREATE INDEX` on a column that does not exist yet would take the whole batch, and the boot, down. Both steps run in one transaction, so a failure leaves the file exactly as it was rather than half-upgraded. Parsing the DDL rather than hand-listing migrations keeps one source of truth, and a test asserts the parsed column set is identical to what SQLite creates from it. A column SQLite could never add to a database that already has rows now fails the build rather than a user's upgrade, and if one ever escapes that gate the bootstrap throws with a message naming the column and the remedy. The boot probe's schema check verifies the resulting columns rather than only that the tables exist, and treats a missing one as fatal. Columns a newer release added are left alone, so opening a newer database with an older Clawboo does not destroy them.
- 650525e: Enabling or disabling an OpenClaw Gateway tool from the Capabilities dashboard now works. The panel offered the button and the request came back rejected every time, because the rule for which rows a source can write was spelled out twice: once where a record is read back from the database, and once in the OpenClaw source that performs the write. They disagreed. The database copy said no OpenClaw config row is writable, which also caught the `tools.allow`/`tools.deny` rows that are in fact the one Gateway write Clawboo supports, so the dashboard rendered a button whose only possible outcome was a 422. Both sides now read one shared predicate, so what the panel offers and what the server allows cannot drift apart again. MCP connectors and plugins stay read-only, since writing those is still unimplemented.

  Fixed a second defect in the same write, which that gate had been hiding: it read the Gateway config from the top level of the `config.get` response instead of unwrapping the snapshot, so on current OpenClaw the existing tool lists read as empty and the patch replaced the whole `tools.allow`/`tools.deny` policy with just the tool being toggled. That would have discarded every other allow and deny entry, including the `sessions_spawn` and `sessions_yield` denies Clawboo relies on to stop agents spawning sub-agents. Toggling a tool now preserves the rest of the policy.

  A toggle attempted while the Gateway is offline now answers 503 with a plain `gateway_disconnected` rather than surfacing a raw error string in the toast.

- ae22d01: Clawboo Native no longer lets an agent drift onto a provider it cannot reach. Three fixes, found by auditing a clean install with a non-Anthropic key. First, seeding a team with no explicit provider (`POST /api/onboarding/seed-native-team` with a bare body) now resolves the provider from what is actually usable instead of assuming Anthropic: the recorded leader-model pick when that provider can still run, then the first connected provider in priority order, and only when nothing is connected at all the old Anthropic fallback. Previously an OpenRouter-only user could seed a team whose agents were configured for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, which passed every health check and then failed every run. A derived pick is recorded as the default leader model only when it can run, and the lazily created universal leader now ignores a recorded pick whose provider has since become unreachable, so neither path can mint a leader that cannot run. A recorded Ollama pick is always honored, since it is keyless and always routes, so choosing a local model is never quietly swapped for a billed provider.

  Second, `PATCH /api/agents/:agentId/model` now accepts an optional `provider` and moves `primaryProvider`, `primaryModel`, and `envVar` together, validating the provider name. The model picker in agent detail sends the provider of the group you clicked rather than guessing from the model id, which matters because the Anthropic, OpenAI, and OpenRouter groups fill with live model lists from the provider once a key is stored, and those ids are not in the curated catalog. Picking another provider's model therefore moves the agent to that provider instead of stranding it posting an unknown model to its old endpoint. An unknown provider is a 400 rather than being silently dropped, a model-only request still changes just the model, which is how a custom id for the current provider is set, and a custom id never re-points the agent's provider.

  The model picker when creating a team had the same blind spot with a quieter symptom: picking one of those live-listed models left the new agent on its provider's default instead, because the pick could not be matched back to a provider and was discarded. It now carries the group through as well, so the model you choose is the model the agent is created with.

  Third, agents now report `providerReady` on `GET /api/agents`: whether a key resolves for that agent's own configured provider, counting fallbacks exactly as the runtime router counts them. Runtime-level health stays deliberately permissive, green when any provider is connected, so this per-agent flag is what reveals an agent parked on a disconnected provider. The agent detail and chat headers show an amber "No provider key" badge with a shortcut into Runtimes for exactly that case, instead of a green badge over an agent that could never reply. The badge is informational and does not block sending, so fixing the key never leaves the composer stuck.

- 38d0111: Reuse one SQLite connection per process instead of opening one per request, and bound the write-retry budget to 1.5 seconds of wall clock so a contended write can no longer block the server for seconds at a time.
- 97bd237: Board statuses and the legal-transition table now come from one shared module (`@clawboo/board-core`) instead of four hand-maintained copies, so the board UI can no longer drift from the transitions the server enforces. The group-chat task card derives its status pill from the same module: a task with an off-list status now shows its raw status name instead of being mislabelled "Queued".
- 86ea611: Give team coordination an event plane and a liveness plane, so agents stop going stale mid-task. The board already carried state correctly, but nothing pushed a change to a running agent and nothing proved a run was still alive, which is why a cascade could look busy while everyone in it had gone quiet. Three things change. A post-commit board lifecycle bus now fires on every task create, release, status change and execution completion, and a durable per-agent mailbox delivers to a teammate exactly once across every channel it might arrive on: a digest at the start of the next run, a live signal into a native run already in flight, or a trailing block on the next MCP tool response, which is what finally reaches spawned runtimes like Codex and Claude Code mid-run. Liveness became a fact instead of a guess: every drain that claims a board task now heartbeats it every 30 seconds on a timer rather than on event traffic, so a working-but-silent run keeps proving itself, and the stale sweep that reclaims abandoned work dropped from an hour to three minutes without any risk of releasing live work. Orphan reaping on boot is liveness-aware, a drain that stops producing events is bounded by an idle timeout instead of hanging forever, waiting on a busy agent times out instead of wedging that agent's chat and schedules, and a user Stop is now durable so a restart cannot resurrect stopped work. A dispatch pump means delegation-derived work fires on its own instead of waiting for someone to type, bounded by a ledger fire policy so a permafailing task cannot loop. Orchestrator eviction is gated on quiescence, so walking away from a long cascade no longer aborts every delegate in it at the thirty-minute mark. The verification fix loop now runs outside the per-identity mutex, where it can actually acquire it, so a failed verification gets its retry instead of stalling.

  Two changes affect installs that already exist, so they are worth calling out separately. Native team agents now get the TeamChat MCP and a read-only Tasks MCP attached by default, where both were previously off: board writes stay engine-owned, because a model-issued create or claim races the orchestrator, but reads were never the risk and without them a leader could not see the board it presides over. And because nothing rewrites a stored agent's tools, agents created before this release are frozen with both switched off, which disables the coordination plane they are now expected to use. A one-shot repair therefore runs at first boot after upgrade and turns those two axes back on for existing native agents, leaving every other tool toggle exactly as the user set it. It runs once, records that it ran, and never reverses a later deliberate change.

- 70841f3: Reject task dependency links that would introduce a direct or transitive cycle.
- 992b546: Bound task creation at the Tasks MCP boundary so a looping agent can no longer fill the board. `create_subtask` (and `create_task` with a `parentTaskId`) return a tool error once a parent has 24 live children or the task would nest more than 2 levels deep; a parentless `create_task` is rate-limited to 30 root tasks per rolling 5 minutes. Each check shares one transaction with its insert, so two attached runtimes racing the same parent cannot both slip past a ceiling. An unknown or empty parent id now returns a tool error instead of failing the tool call with a protocol error, and every refusal carries a machine-readable reason so a repeat offender trips the circuit breaker instead of looping. A parented `create_task` now inherits the parent's team. A dependency cycle over the REST board API returns 409 instead of 500, and the ancestor-chain walk terminates instead of hanging if a database has a corrupt parent cycle. Fix a related off-by-one that let the orchestrator create depth-2 tasks the executor then refused to run forever: the depth ceiling now lives in one shared constant, and the deepest task that can be created is also dispatchable. Hitting the per-turn fan-out cap now writes the `cap_hit` audit row the Governance dashboard has always documented. A multi-step plan emitted by a task already at the depth ceiling is now refused once, up front, instead of quietly creating every step one level too deep where nothing could ever run them.
- 7903898: A team-chat run that ends without an answer now says why. Previously this was a silent non-response: you sent a message, the agent showed Working for a moment, and then nothing arrived, which is indistinguishable from an agent that simply chose not to answer. The reason was written only to the observability log, where nobody looking at the conversation would find it.

  Two shapes of silence are covered. A run that fails before producing any text posts the reason, and the most common cause is also the most fixable, so an agent whose provider has no key is pointed at that runtime's settings by name rather than at a fixed one. A run whose stream simply stops without ever reporting a terminal now says that too, rather than leaving the chat empty. Both are posted as system messages, not as the agent's turn, so neither is mistaken for something the agent said or filtered out as a refusal.

  A run the server itself ended reports that too, naming the cause: a budget cap, or a run that went quiet long enough for the watchdog to end it. These arrive as ordinary aborts, indistinguishable from someone pressing Stop, so they were previously swallowed as if the silence had been chosen.

  Runs that should stay quiet still do. A run that dies part way through a reply commits the partial text it already streamed, which speaks for itself, and that now holds whether the run reported an error or its stream simply stopped: previously the second case cleared the reply off the screen and replaced it with a notice saying nothing had come back. A leader that delegates and has nothing to add speaks through the board. A delegated child run reports on the board too, where a notice would surface in a room the user never opened. And a run the user stopped is not a failure at all.

  Telling those apart needed a fix in the Claude Code runtime. Stopping one of its runs reported a crash rather than a deliberate stop, because that runtime, alone among the four, did not mark its own aborts. It now does, the way the native, Codex and Hermes runtimes already did. That also changes what the board does with a stopped run: previously a Stop was recorded as a failure, which blocked the task and cancelled whatever depended on it, and it is now released the way a stop should be.

- f1c95d0: Stop a replayed Gateway `chat:final` from re-committing a turn or double-billing its tokens, keep verbatim re-utterances in the transcript, and bound the rendered chat timeline with a "Load earlier messages" control.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8d96a6c: ---

  ## "clawboo": patch

  Team chat reliability, plus provider and model UX:
  - **Replies no longer vanish** — every streamed team-chat reply now commits to the transcript (or is cleanly cleared), so a delegating agent's message can't disappear on the next update or on reload. A native 1:1 reply that fails mid-stream is preserved instead of silently dropped.
  - **Live Working/Idle badges** — the sidebar agent and Group Chat status indicators update in real time for native / server-orchestrated team runs and native 1:1 chats, not just OpenClaw over a live Gateway.
  - **Runtime provider manager** — the Runtimes panel's Manage view for Clawboo Native, OpenClaw, and Hermes lists the LLM providers you have actually connected (synced with Settings → Providers), each with per-provider connect/disconnect, one-click reconnect using an existing key, and a default-model picker for Native. A native runtime with no key now honestly reads "Disconnected" with a "Set up in Runtimes" shortcut instead of a false ed".
  - **Reconnect any provider** — reconnecting Clawboo Native is no longer Anthropic-only; reconnect with any provider you have already configured.
  - **Two-layer team model picker** — when creating a team, pick a provider first (only the connected ones), then its model. The picker shows the exact default model that will run instead of an opaque "Recommended", and opens on the provider the current model actually belongs to.
  - **Onboarding tidy** — the Add-runtimes step shows connected providers read-only, with a Back button to the provider step where keys are added.
  - **Sidebar tooltip** — the mascot's hover tooltip appears promptly and reads "Boo Zero", matching what clicking it opens.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d543d11: Native-first. Clawboo now runs Gateway-free on a single provider key: onboarding connects a key, optionally adds Claude Code / Codex / Hermes / OpenClaw, then deploys a real marketplace team. Adds a providers hub across ten providers with live model lists, per-agent runtime and model pickers, and a first-run capability tour. Native teams chat and delegate end to end, with orchestration running server-side so a cascade survives a tab close. The Ghost Graph gains runtime badges, model orbitals, and MCP connector nodes, so every agent surfaces its attached MCP and built-ins. A degraded Gateway no longer blocks the dashboard: a non-blocking banner offers the recovery that actually applies.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- The v0.2.0 liberated cut. Native agents are built in (paste a provider key, no external CLI), and OpenClaw, Claude Code, Codex, and Hermes join as peer teammates in one chat, sharing one durable board, one tiered memory, and one capability dashboard, all governed and verified. Includes the team-task scheduler, per-runtime native homes, an encrypted credential vault under `~/.clawboo/`, and a release-cut security audit. See CHANGELOG.md for the full arc.

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- 53a05b2: Welcome redesign, lighter install, and team color collections:
  - **New calm Day-sky welcome** — a soft animated sky with drifting clouds (pure CSS/SVG) replaces the WebGL ShaderGradient atmosphere on the onboarding splash and home welcome, with a faint "boo-verse" of distant boo silhouettes drifting behind the clouds. The welcome is theme-independent (always the bright sky).
  - **Removed the WebGL/three.js stack** (`@shadergradient/react`, `@react-three/fiber`, `three`, `three-stdlib`) — smaller install/bundle, no GPU cost on first paint.
  - **Fresh installs default to light theme** so onboarding happens in light mode; switch to light/dark/system anytime after.
  - **Team color collections** — each team picks from 8 color palettes with per-team hue rotation, and the create-team preview matches the deployed palette (DB migration 0004).
  - **Token-usage tracking by team & agent**; onboarding flow improvements; removed the unused Ollama-check API.

- 6f718e2: Fixed a Windows hang in `/api/system/status` (hit by the onboarding DetectStep): the synchronous `where` / `which` binary probe (`findExecutable`) is now timeout-bounded, so a slow spawn under Windows Defender can no longer block the server's event loop and stall the request.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- 4ecda72: Light/dark theme with toggle + persisted preference, premium design-system pass (4-tier surfaces, type scale, motion), Atlas radial layout, GitHub star CTA, authentic provider brand marks + app-consistent model dropdown in onboarding, and onboarding-hang/atmosphere fixes.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- 9309ee0: Fix device pairing on fresh macOS installs (v0.1.7):
  - `POST /api/system/approve-device` now uses `spawnSync` for the `openclaw devices approve --latest` preview step so the CLI's preview-mode non-zero exit code no longer swallows the request-id stdout we need to parse. Step 2 (the real approval) keeps `execFileSync` but surfaces `stderr` / `stdout` from any thrown error instead of Node's `Command failed: <argv>` wrapper.
  - The onboarding wizard's `StartGatewayStep` now catches `GatewayResponseError { code: 'NOT_PAIRED' }` and renders the in-product `DevicePairingApproval` card inline. Users no longer have to do a manual page refresh to escape the wizard's "Something went wrong" panel on a fresh-install machine with OpenClaw 2026.5.x. After approval, the wizard auto-retries the connect and advances normally.

- 9038cab: Windows compatibility hardening (bundled into v0.1.7):

  **`.cmd` spawn failures**: Windows users hit "Network error" at the install-OpenClaw step because Node 18.20.2+ refuses to launch `.cmd` / `.bat` files without `shell: true` (CVE-2024-27980 hardening). The throw escaped the request handler after SSE headers were flushed and the browser surfaced the dropped connection as a generic network failure. Added `shell: isWindows` to six `child_process` call sites that target `.cmd` shims (detectOpenClaw, approveDevicePOST steps 1+2, installOpenclawPOST, gatewayControlPOST start, getModelsFromCli) and wrapped the two SSE-emitting sites in try/catch so synchronous spawn errors surface as clean SSE events instead of crashing the request handler.

  **Windows polish**: further testing surfaced four more issues:
  - `cmd.exe` console window popped up in front of the dashboard on every shellout — `shell: true` opens a visible console on Windows by default. Added `windowsHide: isWindows` alongside every `shell: isWindows` (six sites).
  - CLI dashboard poll timed out after 15s — bumped to 45s (90 × 500ms) in `apps/cli/src/index.ts` because the bundled CJS cold-boot on Windows is slow (Windows Defender real-time scanning + Node's first-load module compile).
  - `agents.create` timed out at 30s on team deploy — bumped the gateway-client's default RPC timeout from 30s to 60s and added per-call 120s overrides to `agents.create` and `agents.files.set` to cover the worst-case OpenRouter model-capabilities fetch on Windows (observed up to 74s in user logs).
  - "Retry" button at the Gateway-start step didn't recover (only page refresh did) because the 15s server-side polling fired before the Gateway finished binding (~51s on Windows), and a Retry click would spawn a duplicate openclaw process racing the first for port 18789. Bumped server polling to 60s (120 × 500ms), extracted the polling loop into a `pollUntilReachable` helper, and added a mid-launch detection check via `readGatewayPid` + `isProcessAlive` — if a previous request already spawned the Gateway and its pid is alive, the new request joins the existing polling instead of spawning a duplicate.

  All of the above are no-ops on Unix; macOS compatibility is preserved.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 7a8c3ff: fix(bootstrap): always verify OpenClaw install state instead of trusting stale localStorage.

  Users running 'npx clawboo' on a machine where they'd previously
  onboarded an OLDER clawboo but then uninstalled OpenClaw got dumped
  straight to the 'Connect to an OpenClaw Gateway' screen. The connect
  attempt then failed with 'Gateway closed (1011): upstream error'
  because no OpenClaw was running, and there was no way to re-run the
  install wizard from that point.

  Root cause: GatewayBootstrap had a fast-path optimization that
  returned early when localStorage['clawboo.onboarded'] was set, never
  calling /api/system/status. localStorage persists by browser origin
  (localhost:18790) — it survives uninstalling the npm package AND
  clearing ~/.openclaw/. So a once-onboarded user couldn't re-enter
  the wizard even after a full system reset.

  Fix: always fetch /api/system/status. If OpenClaw is installed AND
  configured, mark onboarded (idempotent) and skip the wizard.
  Otherwise clear the stale localStorage flag and sw the wizard so
  the user can re-install + reconfigure. The on-disk system state is
  the source of truth; localStorage is just a hint cleared whenever
  they disagree.

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- 1cc97fe: feat(connection): in-dashboard device pairing approval for OpenClaw 2026.5+.

  OpenClaw 2026.5.x dropped auto-pair-on-first-connect. Every fresh
  Clawboo install hits a NOT_PAIRED rejection on first connect, requiring
  the user to drop into a terminal and run two openclaw CLI commands.

  This release adds an inline "Approve this device" UI in the Gateway
  connect screen. When the connect throws NOT_PAIRED, the form swaps to
  a single button that hits a new POST /api/system/approve-device
  endpoint. The server shells out to `openclaw devices approve --latest`
  to extract the pending requestId, then `openclaw devices approve <UUID>`
  for the actual approval (--latest alone is a preview-only flag; the
  explicit ID is required for approval).

  After approval, the SPA auto-retries the original connect attempt with
  the same URL + token state. Users complete onboarding with a single
  button click instead of context-switching to a terminal.

  The approval UI also shows the manual CLI fallback (openclaw devices
  approve --latest → openclaw devices approve <requestId>) as a footer
  hint for power users who prefer terminal workflows or whose openclaw
  CLI is on a non-standard PATH.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 68ebc29: fix: OpenClaw protocol-4 compatibility + Windows install support.

  Two independent blockers prevented users from completing onboarding:
  1. PROTOCOL MISMATCH. OpenClaw 2026.5.18 (latest) bumped the WS connect
     protocol from 3 to 4. Clawboo's gateway-client advertised maxProtocol: 3
     only, so every fresh install (which ran `npm install -g openclaw@latest`)
     got an incompatible openclaw and hit "Something went wrong: protocol
     mismatch" at connect time.

     Fix: bump maxProtocol to 4 in packages/gateway-client/src/client.ts.
     minProtocol stays at 3 so older openclaw (2026.3.x and earlier) still
     negotiates correctly. Also pinned the install spec to `openclaw@^2026.5`
     so a future minor bump landing protocol 5 doesn't silently break users.

  2. WINDOWS SPAWN ENOENT. Windows users saw `Error: spawn npm ENOENT` when
     clicking Install in onboarding, AND the OpenClaw detection step always
     reported "not installed" even after a successful manual `npm install -g`.
     Both root-caused to Unix-only commands: `execFileSync('which', ...)` and
     `spawn('npm', ...)` (Windows npm is npm.cmd).

     Fix: new apps/web/server/lib/platform.ts helper with findExecutable
     (cross-platform which/where) and resolveShimName (appends .cmd on
     Windows). Applied at system.ts:57+343, modelCache.ts:59, and
     processManager.ts:74 (which also gained a netstat-based fallback for
     port-to-PID lookup on Windows). CI smoke-test-bundle now runs on a
     matrix of [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest] so Windows regressions can't
     ship undetected.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- aef820f: fix(cli): HTTP-verify Clawboo identity during port discovery, don't TCP-probe blindly.
  The OpenClaw Gateway listens on auxiliary ports (18791, 18792) in addition to its main 18789. Those fall inside Clawboo's 18790-18809 fallback window. v0.1.2's `findRunningDashboard()` did a TCP-only probe, so when 18790 was free but 18791 was held by Gateway (or by Chrome's --remote-debugging-port, or any other listener), the CLI mistook the unrelated port for Clawboo's already-running dashboard, skipped spawning the bundled server, and opened the browser to that port's 401 page (rendered as "Unauthorized" plain text).
  Fix: new `probeClawbooDashboard()` does a TCP probe AND a Clawboo-shaped JSON check on `/api/settings`. Only ports that return a real Clawboo response are accepted.
  Also adds `scripts/test-clean-install.mjs` — a full clean-install simulation that boots a fake non-Clawboo listener on 18791 before invoking the CLI, guaranteeing this exact regression class can't ship again. Wired into both `ci.yml` (PR gate) and `publish.yml` (last-line defense before npm publish).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- e7b9363: fix(server): SPA root path now serves index.html in the bundled production server.

  Replaces an Express 5 wildcard catch-all (`/{*splat}`) that failed to match the bare `/` path under path-to-regexp v8 with a version-agnostic `app.use(handler)` SPA pattern. Also adds a `smoke-test-bundle` CI job that boots the bundled server and curls `/` so this class of bug can't ship again.

  Fixes the "Cannot GET /" that affected v0.1.1.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes
